Weâ€™re excited to announce our new ***#100DaysOfOffensiveHacking*** Challenges! 

![](https://i.ibb.co/Ptyy8Ln/Screenshot-20241216-175549.png)
- Hereâ€™s the deal: weâ€™ve put together a kick4ss team of passionate hackers to create a challenging way for you to level up your offensive security skills

Hereâ€™s how itâ€™s going down:

   -> Daily challenges: Youâ€™ll get* one hacking challenge each day to deal with and grow your skills.
   
   ->  Learning resources: Only Free resources will be shared to guide you through the stuff.
  
   ->  Prove it: Completed a challenge? Great! Submit a Pull Request (PR) to the `/proofs` directory under the respective day's folder on this GitHub repo. Include screenshots or a link proving youâ€™ve completed the challenge. Thatâ€™s how you show youâ€™ve crushed it!
  
   -> Win rewards: Complete all 100 days, prove your skills, and youâ€™ll earn free Udemy coupons to level up even further.

But hereâ€™s the deal:
- No skids, no noobs: Donâ€™t bring lame behavior here. If you mess around, act like a skid, or waste anyoneâ€™s time, weâ€™ll kick you out without notice. Keep it clean, stay sharp, and focus on growth.

All tasks, results, and discussions will be tracked on GitHub. This isnâ€™t just about the grind; itâ€™s about building skills and community.
